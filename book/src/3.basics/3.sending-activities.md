# ðŸ’¬ Sending Activities

To send an activity you can either use the `send` or `reply` methods. You can also `stream` chunks of an activity.

## Send

> Example: a bot that listens for when a member is added to the conversation and sends a greeting.

```typescript
app.on("conversationUpdate", async ({ activity, send }) => {
  for (const account of activity.membersAdded || []) {
    await send(`ðŸ‘‹ welcome ${account.name}!`);
  }
});
```

## Reply

> Example: an echo bot that listens for messages sent to it and responds.

```typescript
app.on("message", async ({ activity, reply, send }) => {
  await send({ type: "typing" }); // send typing indicator...
  await reply(`you said: "${activity.text}"`);
});
```

## Streaming

```typescript
app.on("message", async ({ activity, stream }) => {
  stream.emit("hello");
  stream.emit(", ");
  stream.emit("world!");

  // result message: "hello, world!"
});
```

## Proactive Messaging

In the above examples, the bot is reacting to the messages that are sent to it. However, there are times when you want to send a message to the user without them sending a message first. This is called proactive messaging. You can do this by using the `send` method in the `app` instance. This is useful for sending notifications or reminders to the user.

The main thing to note is that you need to have the `conversationId` of the user you want to send the message to. It's a good idea to store this value somewhere from an activity handler so you can use it for proactive messaging later.

```typescript
await app.send(conversationId, "Don't forget to eat your vegetables!");
```
