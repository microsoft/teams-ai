# Activity: Read Receipt Event

A read receipt event is sent when a user has read a message, and in the UI shows as an eye icon next to the message.

```typescript
app.on('readReceipt', async ({ activity }) => {});
```

`'readReceipt'` is alias for the event name `'application/vnd.microsoft.readReceipt'`.

## Read receipts

Bots can also subscribe to read receipts to track when a message has been read by a user. For example, if a read receipt is not received by the bot, the bot could send a follow-up message in personal chat.

Please note that in Teams, the RSC `ChatMessageReadReceipt.Read.Chat` permissions must be added to the app manifest to receive read receipts.
