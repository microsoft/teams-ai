# Message Reaction

Message reaction activities represent a social interaction on an existing message activity within a conversation. The original activity is referred to by the `id` and `conversation` fields within the activity. The `from` field represents the source of the reaction (i.e., the user that reacted to the message).

```typescript
app.on('messageReaction', async ({ activity }) => {});
```

## Schema

Message reaction activities are identified by a `type` value of `messageReaction`.

### Reactions added

The `reactionsAdded` field contains a list of reactions added to this activity. The value of the `reactionsAdded` field is an array of type [`messageReaction`](https://github.com/microsoft/Agents/blob/main/specs/activity/protocol-activity.md#message-reaction-activity).

### Reactions removed

The `reactionsRemoved` field contains a list of reactions removed from this activity. The value of the `reactionsRemoved` field is an array of type `messageReaction`.

## Message reaction usage in Teams
