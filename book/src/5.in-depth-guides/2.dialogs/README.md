# Dialogs

Dialogs are a helpful paradigm in Teams which improve interactions between your agent and users. When dialogs are **invoked**, they pop open a window for a user in the Teams client. The content of the dialog can be supplied by the agent application.

## Key benefits

1. Dialogs pop open for a user in the Teams client. This means in group-settings, dialog actions are not visible to other users in the channel, reducing clutter.

2. Interactions like filling out complex forms, or multi-step forms where each step depends on the previous step are excellent use cases for dialogs.

3. The content for the dialog can be hard-coded in, or fetched at runtime. This makes them extremely flexible and powerful.
