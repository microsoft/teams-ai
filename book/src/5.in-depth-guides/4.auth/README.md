# ðŸ”’ User Authentication

At times agents must access secured online resources on behalf of the user, such as checking email, checking on flight status, or placing an order. The user must authorize the agent to do so on their behalf, and in order to authorize the agent, the user must authenticate their identity. OAuth is used to authenticate the user and authorize the agent.
