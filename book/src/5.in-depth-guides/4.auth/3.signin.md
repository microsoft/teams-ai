# Authentication in code

### Signing In

Prompting the user to sign in using an `OAuth` connection has
never been easier! Just use the `signin` method to send the request
and the listen to the `signin` event to handle the token result.

```ts
{{#include ../../../generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.auth-signin.ts }}
```

### Signout

Sign a user out by calling the `signout` method to discard the cached access token in the Bot Framework token service.

```ts
{{#include ../../../generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.auth-signout.ts }}
```
