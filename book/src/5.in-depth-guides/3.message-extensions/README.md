# ðŸ“– [Message Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions?tabs=desktop)

Message extensions (or Compose Extensions) enable users to engage with your web service through buttons and forms within the Microsoft Teams client. Users can search or initiate actions in an external system from the compose message area, the command box, or directly from a message. The results of these interactions can be returned to the Teams client as a richly formatted card.

There are two types of message extensions: [API-based](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/api-based-overview) and [Bot-based](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/build-bot-based-message-extension?tabs=search-commands). This library supports bot-based message extensions only.
