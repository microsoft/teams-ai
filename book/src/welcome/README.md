<center><h1>Teams AI Library v2</h1></center>

Teams AI Library v2 is a suite of packages used to develop on Microsoft Teams. Rebuilt from the ground up with improved developer experience in mind, it's never been easier to build powerful agents and applications for the hundreds of millions Microsoft Teams users.

## Quickstart

The Teams CLI makes it easy to bootstrap your first agent. First, install the CLI via NPM:

<!-- langtabs-start -->
```sh
npm install -g @microsoft/teams.cli@preview
```
<!-- langtabs-end -->

Next, use the CLI to create your agent:

<!-- langtabs-start -->
```sh
teams new quote-agent --template echo
```
<!-- langtabs-end -->

For more information, follow our [quick start guide](../getting-started/quickstart.md).

## Overview

Microsoft Teams has a robust developer ecosystem with a broad suite of capabilities, now unified via Teams AI v2. Whether you are building [AI-powered agents](../in-depth-guides/ai/README.md), [message extensions](../in-depth-guides/message-extensions/README.md), embedded web applications, or Graph, Teams AI v2 has you covered.

Here is a simple example, which responds to incoming messages with information retrieved from Graph.

<!-- langtabs-start -->
```typescript
import { App } from '@microsoft/teams.apps';
import { DevtoolsPlugin } from '@microsoft/teams.dev';

const app = new App({
  plugins: [new DevtoolsPlugin()],
});

// Listen for incoming messages
app.on('message', async ({ api, isSignedIn, send, signin }) => {
  if (!isSignedIn) {
    await signin(); // initiates Entra login flow
    return;
  }
  const me = await api.user.me.get();
  await send(`Hello, ${me.displayName} from Earth!`);
});

// Start your application
(async () => {
  await app.start();
})();
```
<!-- langtabs-end -->
