# Anatomy of an App

After creating your first Teams application, let's understand its structure and key components. This will help you build more complex applications as you progress.

## Project Structure

When you create a new Teams application, it generates a directory with this basic structure:

```
quote-agent/
|── appPackage/       # Teams app package files
├── src/
│   └── index.ts      # Main application code
```

## Core Components

Let's break down the simple application we created earlier:

### The App Class

The heart of your application is the `App` class. This class handles all incoming activities and manages your application's lifecycle. It also acts as a

```typescript
import { App } from "@microsoft/teams.apps";
import { ConsoleLogger } from "@microsoft/teams.common/logging";
import { DevtoolsPlugin } from "@microsoft/teams.dev";

const app = new App({
  plugins: [new DevtoolsPlugin()],
});
```

The App configuration includes a variety of options which allow you to customize its behavior from controlling the underlying server, authentication, and others. For simplicity sake, let's focus on plugins.

### Plugins

Plugins are a core part of the Teams AI SDK. They allow you to hook into various lifecycles of the application. The lifecycles include server events (start, stop, initialize etc.), and also Teams Activity events (onActivity, onActivitySent, etc.). In fact, the [DevTools](../7.devtools/README.md) application you have running is a plugin itself. It allows you to inspect and debug your application in real-time.

> [!CAUTION]
> DevTools is a plugin that should only be used in development mode. It should not be used in production applications since it offers no authentication and allows your application to be accessed by anyone.

### Message Handling

Teams applications respond to various types of activities. The most basic is handling messages:

```typescript
app.on("message", async ({ send, activity }) => {
  await send({ type: "typing" });
  await send(`you said "${activity.text}"`);
});
```

This code:

1. Listens for incoming messages using `app.on('message')`
2. Shows a typing indicator
3. Responds by echoing back the received message

> [!NOTE]
> Type safety is a core tenet of this version of the SDK. You're able to change the activity `name` to a different supported value, and the type-system will automatically adjust the type for `activity` to match the new type.

### Application Lifecycle

Your application starts when you run:

```typescript
(async () => {
  await app.start();
})();
```

This part initializes your application, and if it's configured for Teams, also authenticates it so that it's ready to send and receive messages.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basic structure of your Teams application, you're ready to [run it in Teams](3.running-in-teams.md). After that, you can:

- Add more activity handlers for different types of interactions
- Integrate with external services
- Add interactive cards and dialogs
- Implement AI capabilities
