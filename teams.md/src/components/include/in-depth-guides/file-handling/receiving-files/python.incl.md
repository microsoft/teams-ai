<!-- metadata-table -->

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `unique_id` | The OneDrive/SharePoint drive-item id, when the platform provides it. Present only for files backed by ODSP storage. |
| `name` | File name including its extension (e.g. `report.pdf`). |
| `extension` | File extension without the dot (e.g. `pdf`), from the platform-supplied `file_type`. Absent when the platform omits it. |
| `content_type` | The file's MIME type, when the source provides one. Always unset for files received from a bot activity (every file today): the `file.download.info` attachment carries no MIME type, only the extension surfaced as `extension`. To learn the type of the bytes you actually received, read `content_type` on the downloaded file, which is resolved from the download response. |
| `scope` | The conversation scope the file arrived in (`personal`, `groupChat`, or `channel`). |
| `source` | Where the SDK found the file. Currently always `botActivity`. |
| `content_url` | A browsable link to the file in OneDrive/SharePoint, when known. Not a fetchable download URL. |
| `raw` | The original wire attachment (the metadata object, not the bytes) — see [Access the raw attachment](#access-the-raw-attachment). |

<!-- reusing-downloaded-file -->

```python
downloaded = await file.download()

text = downloaded.text()               # decode as UTF-8
data = downloaded.bytes                # the raw bytes
await downloaded.save_as("./copy.bin") # write to disk, no re-fetch
```

<!-- downloaded-table -->

| Property / method | Description |
|---|---|
| `bytes` | The buffered file bytes. |
| `content_type` | MIME type resolved from the download response header, or the incoming file's metadata type if the response omits one. Falls back to `application/octet-stream` when neither provides a type, so this is never empty. |
| `filename` | The resolved file name. |
| `source_url` | The URL the bytes were fetched from. |
| `text(encoding="utf-8")` | Decode the bytes as UTF-8 (or a given encoding). Lossy; never throws. |
| `save_as(path)` | Write the buffered bytes to a local path (no re-fetch). |
