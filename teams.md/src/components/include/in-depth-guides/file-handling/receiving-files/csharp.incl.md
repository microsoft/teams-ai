<!-- saving-to-disk -->

```csharp

```

<!-- streaming -->

```csharp
await using Stream stream = await file.StreamAsync(cancellationToken);

byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
int read;
while ((read = await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, cancellationToken)) > 0)

```

<!-- metadata-table -->

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `UniqueId` | The OneDrive/SharePoint drive-item id, when the platform provides it. Present only for files backed by ODSP storage. |
| `Name` | File name including its extension (e.g. `report.pdf`). |
| `Extension` | File extension without the dot (e.g. `pdf`), from the platform-supplied `fileType`. Absent when the platform omits it. |
| `ContentType` | The file's MIME type, when the source provides one. Always unset for files received from a bot activity (every file today): the `file.download.info` attachment carries no MIME type, only the extension surfaced as `Extension`. To learn the type of the bytes you actually received, read `ContentType` on the downloaded file, which is resolved from the download response. |
| `Scope` | The conversation scope the file arrived in (`personal`, `groupChat`, or `channel`). |
| `Source` | Where the SDK found the file. Currently always `botActivity`. |
| `ContentUrl` | A browsable link to the file in OneDrive/SharePoint, when known. Not a fetchable download URL. |
| `Raw` | The original wire attachment (the metadata object, not the bytes) — see [Access the raw attachment](#access-the-raw-attachment). |

<!-- reusing-downloaded-file -->

```csharp
DownloadedFile downloaded = await file.DownloadAsync(cancellationToken);

string text = downloaded.Text();                               // decode as UTF-8
byte[] bytes = downloaded.Bytes;                               // the raw bytes
await downloaded.SaveAsAsync("./copy.bin", cancellationToken); // write to disk, no re-fetch
```

<!-- downloaded-table -->

| Property / method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Bytes` | The buffered file bytes as a `byte[]`. |
| `ContentType` | MIME type resolved from the download response header, or the incoming file's metadata type if the response omits one. Falls back to `application/octet-stream` when neither provides a type, so this is never empty. |
| `Filename` | The resolved file name. |
| `SourceUrl` | The URL the bytes were fetched from. |
| `Text(encoding?)` | Decode the bytes as UTF-8 (or a given encoding). Lossy; never throws. |
| `SaveAsAsync(path)` | Write the buffered bytes to a local path (no re-fetch). |

<!-- errors-import -->

<!-- raw-attachment -->

```csharp

IncomingFile? file = await context.Files.FirstAsync(cancellationToken);

if (file is not null)
{
    // `Raw` is the untyped wire attachment: the escape hatch when you need a
    // field the typed surface does not expose. Here we serialize the whole
    // attachment to inspect exactly what the platform sent.
    string wire = JsonSerializer.Serialize(file.Raw);
    await context.ReplyAsync($"raw attachment: {wire}", cancellationToken);
}
