# Creating Dialogs

:::tip
If you're not familiar with how to build Adaptive Cards, check out [the cards guide](../adaptive-cards). Understanding their basics is a prerequisite for this guide.
:::

## Entry Point

To open a dialog, you need to supply a special type of action as to the Adaptive Card. Once this button is clicked, the dialog will open and ask the application what to show.

```python
@app.on_message
async def handle_message(ctx: ActivityContext[MessageActivity]):
    await ctx.reply(TypingActivityInput())

    card = AdaptiveCard(
        schema="http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        body=[
            TextBlock(
                text="Select the examples you want to see!",
                size="Large",
                weight="Bolder",
            )
        ]
    ).with_actions([
        # Special type of action to open a dialog
        TaskFetchAction(value={"OpenDialogType": "webpage_dialog"}).with_title("Webpage Dialog"),
        # This data will be passed back in an event, so we can handle what to show in the dialog
        TaskFetchAction(value={"OpenDialogType": "multi_step_form"}).with_title("Multi-step Form"),
        TaskFetchAction(value={"OpenDialogType": "mixed_example"}).with_title("Mixed Example")
    ])

    # Send the card as an attachment
    message = MessageActivityInput(text="Enter this form").add_card(card)
    await ctx.send(message)
```

## Handling Dialog Open Events

Once an action is executed to open a dialog, the Teams client will send an event to the agent to request what the content of the dialog should be. Here is how to handle this event:

```python
@app.on_dialog_open
async def handle_dialog_open(ctx: ActivityContext[TaskFetchInvokeActivity]):
    """Handle dialog open events for all dialog types."""
    card = AdaptiveCard(...)
    
    # Return an object with the task value that renders a card
    return InvokeResponse(
                body=TaskModuleResponse(
                    task=TaskModuleContinueResponse(
                        value=CardTaskModuleTaskInfo(
                            title="Title of Dialog",
                            card=card_attachment(AdaptiveCardAttachment(content=card)),
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
```

### Rendering A Card

You can render an Adaptive Card in a dialog by returning a card response.

```python

@app.on_dialog_open
async def handle_dialog_open(ctx: ActivityContext[TaskFetchInvokeActivity]):
    """Handle dialog open events for all dialog types."""
    dialog_card = AdaptiveCard(
        schema="http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        body=[
            TextBlock(text="This is a simple form", size="Large", weight="Bolder"),
            TextInput().with_label("Name").with_is_required(True).with_id("name").with_placeholder("Enter your name"),
        ],
        actions=[
            SubmitAction().with_title("Submit").with_data(SubmitActionData(ms_teams={"SubmissionDialogType": "simple_form"}))
        ]
    )
    
    # Return an object with the task value that renders a card
    return InvokeResponse(
                body=TaskModuleResponse(
                    task=TaskModuleContinueResponse(
                        value=CardTaskModuleTaskInfo(
                            title="Simple Form Dialog",
                            card=card_attachment(AdaptiveCardAttachment(content=dialog_card)),
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
```

:::info
The action type for submitting a dialog must be `Action.Submit`. This is a requirement of the Teams client. If you use a different action type, the dialog will not be submitted and the agent will not receive the submission event.
:::

### Rendering A Webpage

You can render a webpage in a dialog as well. There are some security requirements to be aware of:

1. The webpage must be hosted on a domain that is allow-listed as `validDomains` in the Teams app [manifest](/teams/deployment/manifest) for the agent
2. The webpage must also host the [teams-js client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js). The reason for this is that for security purposes, the Teams client will not render arbitrary webpages. As such, the webpage must explicitly opt-in to being rendered in the Teams client. Setting up the teams-js client library handles this for you.

```python
return InvokeResponse(
                body=TaskModuleResponse(
                    task=TaskModuleContinueResponse(
                        value=UrlTaskModuleTaskInfo(
                            title="Webpage Dialog",
                            # Here we are using a webpage that is hosted in the same
                            # server as the agent. This server needs to be publicly accessible,
                            # needs to set up teams.js client library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js)
                            # and needs to be registered in the manifest.
                            url=f"{os.getenv('BOT_ENDPOINT')}/tabs/dialog-webpage",
                            width=1000,
                            height=800,
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
```
