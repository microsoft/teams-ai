# Deployment Guide

We cover the most common setup and deployment steps for testing in teams, including configuration instructions, and references for handling potential issues during deployment.

### User Assigned Managed Identity

This section demonstrates how to configure authentication in your application using a **User Assigned Managed Identity** in Azure. You will require this setup if you have `msaAppType: 'UserAssignedMSI'` for the Azure Bot Service (required in dev env generally).

In your `main.py`, replace the initialization:
```python
app = App(plugins=[DevToolsPlugin()])
```
with the following code to enable User Assigned Managed Identity authentication: 
```python
# Create token factory function for Azure Identity
def create_token_factory():
    def get_token(scopes, tenant_id=None):
        credential = ManagedIdentityCredential(client_id=os.environ.get("CLIENT_ID"))
        if isinstance(scopes, str):
            scopes_list = [scopes]
        else:
            scopes_list = scopes
        token = credential.get_token(*scopes_list)
        return token.token
    return get_token

app = App(
    token=create_token_factory(),
    plugins=[DevtoolsPlugin()]
)
```
The `create_token_factory` function provides a method to retrieve access tokens from Azure on demand, and `token_credentials` passes this method to the app.  

### Missing Service Principal in the Tenant

This error occurs when the application has a single-tenant Azure Bot Service (`msaAppType: 'SingleTenant'`) instance, but your app registration has not yet been linked to a Service Principal in the tenant.  

```sh
```
[ERROR] @teams/app Failed to refresh bot token: Client error '401 Unauthorized' for url 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/50612dbb-0237-4969-b378-8d42590f9c00/oauth2/v2.0/token'

```

1. **Sign in to Azure Portal**  
   Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and log in with your Azure account.
2. **Navigate to App Registrations**  
   In the top search bar, search for **App registrations** and select it.
3. **Search for your application**  
   Use the **BOT_ID** from your environment file:  
   - Local development → `env/.env.local`  
   - Azure deployment → `env/.env.dev`
4. **Check if a Service Principal exists**  
   Open the app registration and verify if a Service Principal is created. If it exists already, you should see an entry for a **Managed Application in your local directory** if it exists.

5. **Create a Service Principal if missing**  
   If it doesn’t exist, click **Create Service Principal** . Wait for the page to finish loading.

6. **Restart your app**  
   Once the Service Principal is created, restart your application.
