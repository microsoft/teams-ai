# ⚙️ Settings

You can add a settings page that allows users to configure settings for your app.

The user can access the settings by right-clicking the app item in the compose box.

<br/>   
<img src={SettingsImgUrl} height="300px" alt="Settings" />

This guide will show how to enable user access to settings, as well as setting up a page that looks like this:

## 1. Update the Teams Manifest

Set the `canUpdateConfiguration` field to `true` in the desired message extension under `composeExtensions`.

```json
"composeExtensions": [
    {
        "botId": "${{BOT_ID}}",
        "canUpdateConfiguration": true,
        ...
    }
]
```

## 2. Serve the settings `html` page

This is the code snippet for the settings `html` page:

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="html"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.message-ext-settings-page.html"
/>

Save it in the `index.html` file in the same folder as where your app is initialized.

You can serve it by adding the following code to your app:

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="typescript"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.message-ext-serve-html.ts"
/>

:::note
This will serve the HTML page to the `${BOT_ENDPOINT}/tabs/settings` endpoint as a tab. See [Tabs Guide](../tabs/README.md) to learn more.

## 3. Specify the URL to the settings page

To enable the settings page, your app needs to handle the `message.ext.query-settings-url` activity that Teams sends when a user right-clicks the app in the compose box. Your app must respond with the URL to your settings page. Here's how to implement this:

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="typescript"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.message-ext-query-settings-url.ts"
/>

## 4. Handle Form Submission

When a user submits the settings form, Teams sends a `message.ext.setting` activity with the selected option in the `activity.value.state` property. Handle it to save the user's selection:

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="typescript"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.message-ext-setting.ts"
/>
