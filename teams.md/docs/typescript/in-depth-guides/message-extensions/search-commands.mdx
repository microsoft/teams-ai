# üîç Search commands

Message extension search commands allow users to search external systems and insert the results of that search into a message in the form of a card.

## Search command invocation locations

There are three different areas search commands can be invoked from:

1. Compose Area
2. Compose Box

### Compose Area and Box

## Setting up your Teams app manifest

To use search commands you have define them in the Teams app manifest. Here is an example:


```json
"composeExtensions": [
    {
        "botId": "${{BOT_ID}}",
        "commands": [
            {
                "id": "searchQuery",
                "context": [
                    "compose",
                    "commandBox"
                ],
                "description": "Test command to run query",
                "title": "Search query",
                "type": "query",
                "parameters": [
                    {
                        "name": "searchQuery",
                        "title": "Search Query",
                        "description": "Your search query",
                        "inputType": "text"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```


Here we are defining the `searchQuery` search (or query) command.

## Handle submission

Handle opening adaptive card dialog when the `searchQuery` query is submitted.

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="typescript"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.message-ext-query.ts"
/>

`createDummyCards()` function

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="typescript"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/card.snippet.message-ext-create-dummy-cards.ts"
/>

The search results include both a full adaptive card and a preview card. The preview card appears as a list item in the search command area:

![Search command preview card](/screenshots/preview-card.png)

When a user clicks on a list item the dummy adaptive card is added to the compose box:
