# Handling Dialog Submissions

Dialogs have a specific `dialog.submit` event to handle submissions. When a user submits a form inside a dialog, the app is notified via this event, which is then handled to process the submission values, and can either send a response or proceed to more steps in the dialogs (see [Multi-step Dialogs](./handling-multi-step-forms)).

In this example, we show how to handle dialog submissions from an Adaptive Card form:

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="typescript"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.dialog-submission.ts"
/>

Similarly, handling dialog submissions from rendered webpages is also possible:

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="typescript"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.dialog-submission-webpage.ts"
/>
