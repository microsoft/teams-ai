# ðŸ¤– AI

The AI packages in this library are designed to make it easier to build applications with LLMs.
The `@microsoft/teams.ai` package has two main components:

## ðŸ“¦ Prompts

A `Prompt` is the component that orchestrates everything, it handles state management,
function definitions, and invokes the model/template when needed. This layer abstracts many of
the complexities of the Models to provide a common interface.

## ðŸ§  Models

A `Model` is the component that interfaces with the LLM, being given some `input` and returning the `output`.
This layer deals with any of the nuances of the particular Models being used.

It is in the model implementation that the individual LLM features (i.e. streaming/tools etc.)
are made compatible with the more general features of the `@microsoft/teams.ai` package.

:::note
You are not restricted to use the `@microsoft/teams.ai` package to build your Teams Agent applications. You can use models directly if you choose. These packages are there to simplify the interactions with the models and Teams.
