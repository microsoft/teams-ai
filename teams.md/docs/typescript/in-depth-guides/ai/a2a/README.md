# A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol

:::note
This package wraps the official [A2A SDK](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-js) for both server and client.
:::

[What is A2A?](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/)

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is a protocol designed to enable agents to communicate and collaborate programmatically. This package allows you to integrate the A2A protocol into your Teams app, making your agent accessible to other A2A clients and enabling your app to interact with other A2A servers.

Install the package:

```bash
npm install @microsoft/teams.a2a
```

## What does this package do?

-   **A2A Server**: Enables your Teams agent to act as an A2A server, exposing its capabilities to other agents through the `/a2a` endpoint and serving an agent card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`.
-   **A2A Client**: Allows your Teams app to proactively reach out to other A2A servers as a client, either through direct `AgentManager` usage or integrated with `ChatPrompt` for LLM-driven interactions.

## High-level Architecture

### A2A Server
```mermaid

    A_S[TeamsApp]
    B[A2APlugin]
    D[External A2A Client]


    D -- "task/send" message --> A_S
    subgraph A2A Server
        direction LR
        A_S --> B
    end
    B -- AgentCard --> D
    B -- "task/send" response --> D
```

### A2A Client

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A_C[TeamsApp]
    C[A2AClientPlugin]
    E[External A2A Server]
    U[Teams User]

    U --> A_C
    subgraph A2A Client
        direction LR
        A_C -- message --> C
        C -- response from server --> A_C
    end
    C -- message task/send --> E
    E -- AgentCard --> C
    E -- task/send response --> C
```
