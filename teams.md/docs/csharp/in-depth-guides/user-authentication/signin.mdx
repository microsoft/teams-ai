# Signing In

Prompting the user to sign in using an `OAuth` connection has
never been easier! Just use the `signin` method to send the request
and the listen to the `signin` event to handle the token result.

<FileCodeBlock
    lang="typescript"
    src="/generated-snippets/ts/index.snippet.auth-signin.ts"
/>
