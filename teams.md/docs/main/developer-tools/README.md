# Developer Tools

One of the main motivations for Teams AI (v2) Library is to provide excellent tools that simplify and speed up building and testing agents. Because of this, we created the CLI for speedy agent initiation and project management, and DevTools as an accessible way to test your agent's behavior without jumping through deployment hoops. DevTools also provides crucial insight on activity payloads on the Activities page.
