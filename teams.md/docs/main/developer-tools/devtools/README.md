# üõ†Ô∏è DevTools

The developer tools can be used to locally interact with an app to streamline the testing/development process,
preventing you from needing to deploy/register the app or expose a public endpoint.

## Basic features

- **Chat**: Chat with your app the same way you would in Teams without the need for an app id or authentication. This is useful for testing and debugging your app.
- **Inspect**: Inspect incoming and outgoing activities on DevTools' Activity page. All activity on your agent logged here, including messages, reactions, and more.
- **Cards**: Use the Cards page to visually design and test your cards.
