# Teams Integration

This section describes Teams-specific features and components of the SDK, helping you understand how your agent integrates with the Microsoft Teams platform.

## Core Concepts

- **DevTunnel**: Enables local development by creating secure public endpoints
- **App Provisioning**: Handles registration and configuration in Teams
- **Environment Setup**: Manages Teams-specific configuration files
- **App Packaging**: Bundles your agent for Teams deployment
