# Teams Integration

This section describes Teams-specific features and components of the SDK, helping you understand how your agent integrates with the Microsoft Teams platform.

## Core Concepts

When working with Teams, several key components come into play:

- **DevTunnel**: Enables local development by creating secure public endpoints
- **App Provisioning**: Handles registration and configuration in Teams
- **Environment Setup**: Manages Teams-specific configuration files
- **App Packaging**: Bundles your agent for Teams deployment

## In This Section

2. [Teams Manifest](manifest.md) - Configuring your agent's Teams presence
3. [Teams Toolkit](teams-toolkit.md) - Using the Teams Toolkit extension for sideloading, deployment, and provisioning.

Each guide provides detailed information about specific aspects of Teams integration, from local development to production deployment.
