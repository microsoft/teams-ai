1. Install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this sample's directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Ensure that you have set up the sample from the previous step.
1. Trigger **Python: Create Environment** from command palette and create a virtual environment
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
