Welcome to the Teams AI SDK! This SDK is designed to help you build bots that can interact with Teams and Microsoft 365 apps. It is built on top of the [Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js) to make it easier to build Teams AI-interacting bots.

For now, code-availability is limited to the [`js`](./js/) folder. **dotnet parity is in production and will be available soon.**

## Getting Started

### 🖇️ Jump right in❗️ ⤵️ 📎

> If you want to jump immediately into AI, try out the [04.ai.a.teamsChefbot](./js/samples/04.ai.a.chefbot) sample. This sample is a simple bot that uses the OpenAI API to build Teams apps.

### Start with migration and other getting started guides

To get started, check out the getting started table of contents.

0. [Migration](getting-started/00.MIGRATION.md) - if you have an existing bot, this guide will help you migrate to this SDK.
1. **\*** [AI Setup](getting-started/01.AI-SETUP.md) - if you're starting from scratch, this guide will help you <large>**get started with AI**</large>.
2. [API-Reference](getting-started/02.API-REFERENCE.md) - this guide will help you understand the API reference.
3. [Prompt injection](getting-started/03.PROMPT-INJECTION.md) - this guide will help you learn the basics of avoiding prompt injection in your bot.

## Capabilities

### Teams-centric component scaffolding

> For examples of the below, browse through the [JS](./js/samples/) folders.
> Simple scaffolding for any conversational app component, inlcuding:

- Chat bots
- Message Extensions
- Link unfurling
- Adaptive Cards

### Natural Language Modelling

The SDK is built to leverage OpenAI Large Language Models so you don't have to create your own. This saves you the complexity of processing natural language, and allows your users to talk to your app with their own words.

### Prompt Engineering

With a simple text file written in human language, you can describe the functionality of your app to cue OpenAI to focus on the right user intentions and provide relevant responses.

### Moderation

A configurable API call to filter inappropriate content for input content, output content, or both. (See [OpenAIModerator.ts](./js/src/openai/OpenAIModerator.ts))

### Predictive Engine to Map Intents to Actions

Leveraging provided prompts and topic filters, it's simple to create a predictive engine that detects user intents and map them to relevant app actions, where you can focus your business logic. These actions are even possible to chain together to make building complex workflows easy.

### Conversational Session History

The state of your user's session is not lost, allowing conversations to flow freely and arrive quickly at right outcome.

### Localization

Because OpenAI's models are trained on the open internet, they're tuned to any language, saving you the cost of localization.

### LLM modularity

While the SDK handles OpenAI's GPT models out of the box, you can choose to swap to the LLM of your choice without touching any of your conversational app code.
