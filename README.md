# Welcome to the Teams AI SDK v2

> \[!CAUTION]
> **PREVIEW VERSION** This is a preview version of the Teams AI SDK v2. While we will do our best to avoid breaking changes, some breaking changes should be expected until the first major version.

## Overview

Teams AI SDK v2 represents a fundamental reimagining of how Teams apps and AI agents are built, while maintaining compatibility with existing botframework-based agents. This new version focuses on developer experience, simplified architecture, and enhanced AI capabilities.

For a detailed explanation of the motivations and architectural decisions behind v2, please see our [WHY.md](./WHY.md) document.
