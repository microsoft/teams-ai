# Teams Light Bot

A conversational bot for Microsoft Teams, designed as an AI assistant. The bot connects to a third-party service to turn a light on or off.

This sample illustrates more complex conversational bot behavior in Microsoft Teams. The bot is built to allow GPT to facilitate the conversation on its behalf as well as manually defined responses, and maps user intents to user defined actions.

It shows following SDK capabilities:

    <summary><h3>Bot scaffolding</h3></summary>
    Throughout the 'Program.cs' and 'TeamsLightBot.cs' files you'll see the scaffolding created to run a bot with AI features.

    <summary><h3>Prompt engineering</h3></summary>
The 'Prompts/chatGPT/skprompt.txt' file has descriptive prompt engineering that, in plain language, instructs GPT how the bot should conduct itself at submit time. For example, in 'skprompt.txt':

#### skprompt.txt

```text
The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. 
The assistant can turn a light on or off.
The assistant must return the following JSON structure:

{"type":"plan","commands":[{"type":"DO","action":"<name>","entities":{"<name>":<value>}},{"type":"SAY","response":"<response>"}]}

The following actions are supported:

- LightsOn
- LightsOff
- Pause time=<duration in ms>
- LightStatus

The lights are currently {{getLightStatus}}.

Always respond in the form of a JSON based plan. Stick with DO/SAY.
```

## Set up instructions

All the samples for the C# .NET SDK can be set up in the same way: You can find step by step instructions here:
 [Setup Instructions](../README.md).

Note that, this sample requires AI service so you need one more pre-step before Local Debug (F5).

1. Set your Azure OpenAI related settings to *appsettings.Development.json*.

    ```json
      "Azure": {
        "OpenAIApiKey": "<your-azure-openai-api-key>",
        "OpenAIEndpoint": "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>"
      }
    ```

## Interacting with the Bot

At this point you should have set up the bot and installed it in Teams. You can interact with the bot by sending it a message.

Here's a sample interaction with the bot:

You can also ask it to dim the lights by flickering the switch really fast.

## Deploy to Azure

You can use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio or CLI to host the bot in Azure. The sample includes Bicep templates in the `/infra` directory which are used by the tools to create resources in Azure.

You can find deployment instructions [here](../README.md).

Note that, this sample requires AI service so you need one more pre-step before deploy to Azure. To configure the Azure resources to have an environment variable for the Azure OpenAI Key and other settings:

1. In `./env/.env.dev.user` file, paste your Azure OpenAI related variables.

    ```bash
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    ```

The SECRET_ prefix is a convention used by Teams Toolkit to mask the value in any logging output and is optional.

## Use OpenAI

Above steps use Azure OpenAI as AI service, optionally, you can also use OpenAI as AI service.

**As prerequisites**

1. Prepare your own OpenAI service.
1. Modify source code `Program.cs`, comment out the "*#Use Azure OpenAI*" part, and uncomment the "*#Use OpenAI*" part.

**For Local Debug (F5) with Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio**

1. Set your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile?tab=api-keys) to *appsettings.Development.json*.

    ```json
      "OpenAI": {
        "ApiKey": "<your-openai-api-key>"
      },
    ```

**For Deploy to Azure with Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio**

To configure the Azure resources to have OpenAI environment variables:

1. In `./env/.env.dev.user` file, paste your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile?tab=api-keys) to the environment variable `SECRET_OPENAI_KEY=`.
