## Set up instructions

All the samples in the C# .NET SDK can be set up in the same way. You can find the step by step instructions here:
 [Setup Instructions](../README.md).

Note that, this sample requires AI service so you need one more pre-step before Local Debug (F5).

1. Set your Azure OpenAI related settings to *appsettings.Development.json*.

    ```json
      "Azure": {
        "OpenAIApiKey": "<your-azure-openai-api-key>",
        "OpenAIEndpoint": "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>",
        "ContentSafetyApiKey": "<your-azure-content-safety-api-key>",
        "ContentSafetyEndpoint": "<your-azure-content-safety-endpoint>"
      }
    ```

## Interacting with the Bot

At this point you should have set up the bot and installed it in Teams. You can interact with the bot by sending it a message.

Here's a sample interaction with the bot:

You can quit the game by sending the message `/quit`.

## Deploy to Azure

You can use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio or CLI to host the bot in Azure. The sample includes Bicep templates in the `/infra` directory which are used by the tools to create resources in Azure.

You can find deployment instructions [here](../README.md#deploy-to-azure).

Note that, this sample requires AI service so you need one more pre-step before deploy to Azure. To configure the Azure resources to have an environment variable for the Azure OpenAI Key and other settings:

1. In `./env/.env.dev.user` file, paste your Azure OpenAI related variables.

    ```bash
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    SECRET_AZURE_CONTENT_SAFETY_API_KEY=
    SECRET_AZURE_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT=
    ```

The `SECRET_` prefix is a convention used by Teams Toolkit to mask the value in any logging output and is optional.

## Use OpenAI

Above steps use Azure OpenAI as AI service, optionally, you can also use OpenAI as AI service.

**For Local Debug (F5) with Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio**

1. Set your [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/api/) to *appsettings.Development.json*.

    ```json
      "OpenAI": {
        "ApiKey": "<your-openai-api-key>"
      },
    ```

**For Deploy to Azure with Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio**

To configure the Azure resources to have OpenAI environment variables:

1. In `./env/.env.dev.user` file, paste your [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/api/) to the environment variable `SECRET_OPENAI_KEY=`.
