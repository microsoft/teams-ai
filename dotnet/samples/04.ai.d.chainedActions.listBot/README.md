    <summary><h3>Bot scaffolding</h3></summary>
    Throughout the 'Program.cs' file you'll see the scaffolding created to run a bot, e.g. storage, authentication, and conversation state.

    <summary><h3>Prompt engineering</h3></summary>
The `Prompts/Chat/`, `Prompts/ChatGPT/` and `Prompts/Summarize` directories have descriptive prompt engineering that, in plain language, instructs GPT how the bot should conduct itself at submit time. For example, in `Prompts/Chat/skprompt.txt`:

#### skprompt.txt

````text
The following is a conversation with an AI assistant.
The assistant can manage lists of items.
The assistant must return the following JSON structure:

{"type":"plan","commands":[{"type":"DO","action":"<name>","entities":{"<name>":<value>}},{"type":"SAY","response":"<response>"}]}

The following actions are supported:

- createList list="<list name>"
- deleteList list="<list name>"
- addItem list="<list name>" item="<text>"
- removeItem list="<list name>" item="<text>"
- findItem list="<list name>" item="<text>"
- summarizeLists

All entities are required parameters to actions

Current list names:

\```
{{getListNames}}
\```

Examples:

human - remind me to buy milk
ai - DO addItem list="groceries" item="milk" SAY Ok I added milk to your groceries list

human - we already have milk
ai - DO removeItem list="groceries" item="milk" SAY Ok I removed milk from your groceries list

human: buy ingredients to make margaritas
ai - DO addItem list="groceries" item="tequila" DO addItem list="groceries" item="orange liqueur" DO addItem list="groceries" item="lime juice" SAY Ok I added tequila, orange liqueur, and lime juice to your groceries list

human - do we have have milk
ai - DO findItem list="groceries" item="milk"

human - what's in my grocery list
ai - DO summarizeLists

human - what's the contents of all my lists?
ai - DO summarizeLists

human - show me all lists but change the title to Beach Party
ai - DO summarizeLists

human - show me all lists as a card and sort the lists alphabetically
ai - DO summarizeLists

Instructions:

Always respond in the form of a JSON based plan. Stick with DO/SAY.

{{$history}}
Human: {{$input}}
AI:
````

- The major section ("_The following is ... Stick with DO/SAY._") defines the basic direction, to tell how AI should behave on human's input.
- The final section ("_Human: ... AI: ..._") defines the human's input and let AI to generate the post response.
- Function "{{getListNames}}\*" is added via AI.Prompt.AddFunction in ListBotApplication.cs.
- You can also add variable via AI.Prompt.Variables, then reference it as "{{$variable}}" in prompt.
- The variables "_{{input}}_", and "_{{history}}_" are automatically resolved from `TurnState.Temp`.

    <summary><h3>Action chaining</h3></summary>
You can find the action handlers in "ListBotActions.cs".

This sample shows how to incorporate basic conversational flow into a Teams application. It also illustrates a few of the Teams specific calls you can make from your bot.

## Set up instructions

All the samples in the C# .NET SDK can be set up in the same way. You can find the step by step instructions here: [Setup Instructions](../README.md).

Note that, this sample requires AI service so you need one more pre-step before Local Debug (F5).

1. Set your Azure OpenAI related settings to _appsettings.Development.json_.

   ```json
     "Azure": {
       "OpenAIApiKey": "<your-azure-openai-api-key>",
       "OpenAIEndpoint": "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>"
     }
   ```

## Interacting with the bot

![List Bot](./assets/ListBot.png)

At this point you should have set up the bot and installed it in Teams. You can interact with the bot by sending it a message.

## Deploy to Azure

You can use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio or CLI to host the bot in Azure. The sample includes Bicep templates in the `/infra` directory which are used by the tools to create resources in Azure.

You can find deployment instructions [here](../README.md#deploy-to-azure).

Note that, this sample requires AI service so you need one more pre-step before deploy to Azure. To configure the Azure resources to have an environment variable for the Azure OpenAI Key and other settings:

1. In `./env/.env.dev.user` file, paste your Azure OpenAI related variables.

   ```bash
   SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
   SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
   ```

The `SECRET_` prefix is a convention used by Teams Toolkit to mask the value in any logging output and is optional.

## Use OpenAI

Above steps use Azure OpenAI as AI service, optionally, you can also use OpenAI as AI service.

**As prerequisites**

1. Prepare your own OpenAI service.
1. Modify source code `Program.cs`, comment out the "_#Use Azure OpenAI_" part, and uncomment the "_#Use OpenAI_" part.

**For debugging (F5)**

1. Set your [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/api/) to _appsettings.Development.json_.

   ```json
     "OpenAI": {
       "ApiKey": "<your-openai-api-key>"
     },
   ```

**For deployment to Azure**

To configure the Azure resources to have OpenAI environment variables:

1. In `./env/.env.dev.user` file, paste your [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/api/) to the environment variable `SECRET_OPENAI_KEY=`.
