## User Authentication Samples

Being able to access user specific data from other third party services is a cruicial capability of any Teams app. These samples showcase the different ways to authenticate a user to third party services such as Microsoft Graph.

There are two approaches to user authentication: `OAuth` and `TeamsSSO`.

The `OAuth` approach requires creating an OAuth connection in the Azure Bot service. It uses the Bot Framework's token service to handle the OAuth2.0 flow on behalf of the bot server.

The `TeamsSSO` approach implements the OAuth 2.0 protocol within the bot web server itself. It gives you more flexibility on how to configure AAD, like using a client certificate. There is no need to create an OAuth connection in Azure Bot service.

Both of these approaches can be used to acheive the sample functionality, such as using the SSO flow to authenticate the user.

| --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth Bot | User authentication in a conversational bot with the `OAuth` apporach. | [JS](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/js/samples/06.auth.oauth.bot), [C#](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/dotnet/samples/06.auth.oauth.bot) |

## Advanced Samples

These samples a combination of advanced features such as AI, user authentication, basic conversational bot and message extension capabilities, resulting in their complexity.

| Name | Description | Languages Supported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who Bot | This bot can tell you about your personal work-related information like who your manager is, when's your next meetings, and so on.
