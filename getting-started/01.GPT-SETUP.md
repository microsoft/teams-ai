# Getting started with bots and GPT

This guide is intended to help you get started with bots and GPT. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a conglamerate of tips that most bots moving to GPT will require.

**Please note, you will need to install node v16.x**

## Private Preview

Since this SDK is still under private preview, there will be instances of breaking changes of the SDK that will require updating your bot/project. Here is an example:

- [Remove `.value` from state context variable names](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-m365/issues/49)
- To find the up-to-date list, use the [breaking changes](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-m365/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abreaking-change) tag for more information. Once the SDK has those changes, customers will be able to update their bots.

## GPT Setup

Once you have a basic bot setup, it is time to prepare the bot for GPT usage.

To use OpenAI's GPT, first create your OpenAI API key using the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/) and storing that key in your .env file:

```sh
MICROSOFT_APP_ID=app-id
MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD=app-password
OPENAI_API_KEY=new-OpenAI-Key
```

Next is to set up the GPT prediction, called `OpenAIPlanner` in this SDK. Check out [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) to get familiar with common terms that are also used in this SDK, e.g. 'prompt', 'tokens', etc.

```js
// Create prediction engine
const planner = new OpenAIPlanner({ /* GPT config settings */});

// create the prompt manager
// Prompt Mnanager directs to the prompts folder
const promptManager = new PromptManager((path.join(__dirname, `../src/prompts`));
```

The `ai` object is passed into the Application, which should recieve the two components above, as well as the default prompt.

```js
const app = new Application({
  storage,
  ai: {
    planner,
    promptManager,
    prompt: "defaultPrompt"
    // ... other options
  }
});
```

For information on how to create and use prompts, see [APIREFERENCE](./02.API-REFERENCE.md).
