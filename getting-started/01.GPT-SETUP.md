# Getting started with bots and GPT

This guide is intended to help you get started with bots and GPT. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a conglamerate of tips that most bots moving to GPT will require.

## Private Preview

Since this SDK is still under private preview, there will be instances of breaking changes of the SDK that will require updating your bot/project. Here is the an example:

- [Remove `.value` from state context variable names](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-m365/issues/49)
- To find the up-to-date list, use the [breaking changes](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-m365/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abreaking-change) tag for more information. Once the SDK has those changes, customers will be able to update their bots.

## GPT Setup

Once you have a basic bot setup, it is time to prepare the bot for GPT usage.

To use OpenAI's GPT, first create your OpenAI API key using the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/) and storing that key in your .env file:

```sh
MICROSOFT_APP_ID=app-id
MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD=app-password
OPENAI_API_KEY=new-OpenAI-Key
```

Next is to set up the GPT prediction, called `OpenAIPlanner` in this SDK. Check out [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) to get familiar with common terms that are also used in this SDK, e.g. 'prompt'

```js
// Create prediction engine
const planner = new OpenAIPlanner({
  configuration: {
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  },
  logRequests: true,
  // path to the AI's prompt file
  prompt: path.join(__dirname, "../src/prompt.txt"),
  promptConfig: {
    frequency_penalty: 0,
    max_tokens: 2048,
    model: "text-davinci-003",
    presence_penalty: 0.6,
    stop: [" Human:", " AI:"],
    temperature: 0.4,
    top_p: 1
  }
});
```
