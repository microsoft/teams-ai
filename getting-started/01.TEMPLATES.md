A simple and powerful way to
define and compose AI functions **using plain text**.
You can use it to create natural language prompts, generate responses, extract
information, **invoke other prompts** or perform any other task that can be
expressed with text.

The language supports two basic features that allow you to (**#1**) include
variables and (**#2**) call functions.

You don't need to write any code or import any external libraries, just use the
curly braces `{{...}}` to embed expressions in your prompts.
Teams AI will parse your template and execute the logic behind it.
This way, you can easily integrate AI into your apps with minimal effort and
maximum flexibility.

## Variables

To include a variable value in your text, use the `{{$variableName}}` syntax.
For example, if you have a variable called `name` that holds the user's name,
you can write:

```Hello {{$name}}!```

This will produce a greeting with the user's name.

Spaces are ignored, so if you find it more readable, you can also write:

```Hello {{ $name }}!```

## Function Calls

To call a function and embed the result in your text, use the
`{{functionName}}` syntax.
For example, if you have a function called `getForecast` that returns
the weather forecast for a given location, you can write:

```The weather today is {{getForecast}}.```

This will produce a sentence with the weather forecast for the default location
stored in the `input` variable.
The `input` variable is set automatically by the kernel when invoking a function.
For instance, the code above is equivalent to:

```The weather today is {{getForecast $input}}.```

## Function Registration

### C#

```C#
AI.Prompts.AddFunction("getForecast", (turnContext, turnState) =>
{
    return Task.FromResult(turnState.Conversation!.Forecast);
});
```

### Javascript

```typescript
app.ai.prompts.addFunction(
    'getForecast',
    async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState) => {
        return state.conversation.value.forecast;
    }
);
```
