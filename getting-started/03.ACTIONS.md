An action is an atomic function that is registered to the AI Module. It is a fundamental building block of a plan. 

Here's an example of how the `createList` action would look like in code:

### C#

```C#
[Action("createList")]
public bool CreateList([ActionTurnState] ListState turnState, [ActionEntities] Dictionary<string, object> entities)
{
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(turnState);
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(entities);

    string listName = GetEntityString(entities, "list");

    // Ex. create a list with name "Grocery Shopping"
    CreateList(listName);

    // Continues exectuion of next command in the plan.
    return true;
}
```

>Adding the `Action` attribute marks the method as an action. To register it to the AI module you have pass the instance object containing this method to the `AI.ImportActions(instance)` method. Alternatively you can use the `AI.RegisterAction(name, handler)` to register a single action.   

### JS/TS

```typescript
app.ai.action('createList', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, data: EntityData) => {
    // Ex. create a list with name "Grocery Shopping".
    createList(data.name);

    // Continues exectuion of next command in the plan. 
    return true;
});
```
>The `action` method registers the action named `createList` with corresponding callback function.

### Python

```python
@app.ai.action("createList")
async def on_create_list(context: ActionTurnContext, state: TurnState):
    # Ex. create a list with name "Grocery Shopping".
    create_list(context.data["name"])

    # Continues exectuion of next command in the plan.
    return True
```
>The `action` decorator registers an action named `createList`. In Python we use the `ActionTurnContext`
to pass the `data` attribute to the callback function.

## Default Actions

The user can register custom actions or override default actions in the system. Below is a list of default actions present:

| Action   | Description  |
|---|---|
| `__UnkownAction___`  | Called anytime an unknown action is predicted by the planner.   |
| `___FlaggedInput___`  | Called anytime an input is flagged by the moderator.   | 
| `___FlaggedOutput___`  | Called anytime an output is flagged by the moderator.   | 
| `___RateLimited___`  | Called anytime the planner is rate limited.   | 
| `___PlanReady___`  | Called after the plan has been predicted by the planner and it has passed moderation.   | 
| `___DO___`  | Called to DO an action. Overriding this action will change how *all* DO commands are handled.  | 
| `___SAY___`  | Called to SAY something. Overriding this action will change how *all* SAY commands are handled.    |

> Detailed description of each action can be found in the codebase.

Notice that `___DO___` and `___SAY___`, despite being called commands, are actually specialized actions. This means that a plan is really a sequence of actions.
