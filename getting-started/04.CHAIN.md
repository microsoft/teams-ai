A chain is a method than runs the end-to-end flow of generating a plan and executing it.

## Examples

Suppose you have the following planner prompt named `listPrompt`:

The following is a conversation with an AI assistant.

```prompt
The assistant can manage lists of items.
The assistant must return the following JSON structure:

{"type":"plan","commands":[{"type":"DO","action":"<name>","entities":{"<name>":<value>}},{"type":"SAY","response":"<response>"}]}

The following actions are supported:

- createList name="<list name>"
- addItem list="<list name>" item="<text>"

User: Create a list called "grocery shopping" and add "bananas" to it.
```

> See [Planner](./02.PLANNER.md) to learn about the planner prompt.

And that you have orchestrated the `AI` module to use an LLM planner like `OpenAIPlanner`.

Calling chain on this prompt will first use the `OpenAIPlanner` to generate a plan that may look like:

```json
{
  "type": "plan",
  "commands": [
    {
      "type": "DO",
      "action": "createList",
      "entities": {
        "name": "grocery shopping"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "DO",
      "action": "addItem",
      "entities": {
        "name": "bananas"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "SAY",
      "response": "Created a grocery shopping list and added bananas to it."
    }
  ]
}
```

Then the chain method will iterate through the list of commands and execute each _action_ registered to the `AI` module.
