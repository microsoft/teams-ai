## Migration Documentation

Welcome to the migration docs! Please note that we currently have two sections:

1. [`js` guidance](./js/)
1. [`dotnet` guidance](./dotnet/)

### Migration

If you are migrating your existing bot, we recommend starting with the respective 00.MIGRATION in the programming language of your bot. Please note that while the content of both sections will be extremely similar, our goal is to provide code examples in the corresponding language.

- [js](./js/00.MIGRATION.md)
- [dotnet](./dotnet/00.MIGRATION.md)

Otherwise, please feel free to browse other pages, including Concepts and Prompt Injection.

## Concepts

TBD.
