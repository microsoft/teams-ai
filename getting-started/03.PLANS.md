## Commands

### DO

An `action` that the AI system should perform

### SAY

A `response` that the AI system should say

### Examples

The following is a `plan` that supports two simple commands. The `DO` command will send input to the app while the `SAY` command handles the response.

```json
{
    "type":"plan",
    "commands":[
        {"type":"DO","action":"<name>","entities":{"<name>":<value>}},
        {"type":"SAY","response":"<response>"}
    ]
}
```
