In a conversation, people often speak one-at-a-time, taking turns speaking. With a bot, it generally reacts to user input. Within the Teams AI Library, a turn consists of the user's incoming activity to the bot and any activity the bot sends back to the user as an immediate response. You can think of a *turn* as the processing associated with the bot receiving a given activity.

> To learn about how an incomming activity is routed, see the Activity Routing ([C#](../getting-started/dotnet/02.ACTIVITY-ROUTING.md))

In each turn the *turn context* and the *turn state* are configured to manage conversational data. 

### Turn Context

The turn context object provides information about the activity such as the sender and receiver, the channel, and other data needed to process the activity.

The turn context is one of the most important abstractions in the SDK. Not only does it carry the inbound activity to all the middleware components and the application logic but it also provides the mechanism whereby the components and the bot logic can send outbound activities.

#### Example

The turn context object is accessible from the activity handler or an action. Here's how to send a message back to the user in an activity handler:

##### C#
```dotnet
// This activity handler method is invoked if `Message` is the incomming activity type.
protected virtual Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, TurnState turnState, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{ 
    // Extract user's message
    string message = turnContext.Activity.Text;
    await turnContext.sendActivity(`You said: ${message}`);
}
```

##### JS/TS

```ts
app.activity(ActivityTypes.Message, async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState) => {
    // Extract user's message
    let message = context.activity.text;
    await context.sendActivity(`You said: ${message}`);
});

```

### Turn State

The turn state object stores cookie-like data for the current turn. Just like the turn context, it is carried through the entire application logic, including the activity handlers and the AI module. Unlike the turn context, then turn state is not pre-poulated by default. The user will have to orchestrate turn state manager, which is used to load/persist the turn state from storage.  

It is used to store information like the user's message, the conversation history, and any custom data configured by the application code.

#### Example

This is how a bot can keep track of the number of messages send by the user using the turn state:

##### C#
```dotnet
// This activity handler method is invoked if `Message` is the incomming activity type.
protected virtual Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, TurnState turnState, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{ 
    int count = turnState.Get<int>("conversationCountKey") ?? 0;
    
    // Send a message back to the user....
}
```

> The `TurnState` class is a wrapper around the .NET Collection `Dictionary`. In the [samples](../dotnet/samples/) custom classes are built around the `TurnState` class to create strongly typed state. 

> 

##### JS/TS

```ts
app.activity(ActivityTypes.Message, async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState) => {
    let count = state.conversation.value.count ?? 0;

    // Send a message back to the user....
});

```



### Appendix

<details>
<summary>What happens when a message is sent to the bot by a user?</summary>
<br>

When a message is sent by the user it is routed to the bots `HTTP POST` endpoint `/api/messages`, which 
starts the routing process.

##### JS/TS

```typescript
server.post('/api/messages', async (req, res) => {
    // Route received a request to adapter for processing
    await adapter.process(req, res as any, async (context) => {
        // Dispatch to application for routing
        await app.run(context);
    });
});
```

##### C#

```dotnet
[Route("api/messages")]
[ApiController]
public class BotController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter _adapter;
    private readonly IBot _bot;

    public BotController(IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter adapter, IBot bot)
    {
        _adapter = adapter;
        _bot = bot;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task PostAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        await _adapter.ProcessAsync
        (
            Request,
            Response,
            _bot,
            cancellationToken
        );
    }
}
```
