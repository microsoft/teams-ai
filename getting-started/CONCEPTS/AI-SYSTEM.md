# The AI System

The AI system is responsible for moderating input and output, generating plans, and executing them. It can be used free standing or routed to by the Application object. This system is encapsulated in the `AI` class. It is made of four components, the moderator, the planner, actions, and data sources.

1. [Moderator](./MODERATOR.md)
2. [Planner](./PLANNER.md)
3. [Actions](./ACTIONS.md)
4. [Data Sources](./DATA-SOURCES.md)
