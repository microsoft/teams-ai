This guide is intended to help you get started with bots and AI. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a conglamerate of tips that most bots moving to AI will require.

## AI Setup

Once you have a basic bot setup, it is time to prepare the bot for AI usage.

To use OpenAI, first create your OpenAI API key using the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/) and storing that key in your `appsettings.Development.json` or `appsettings.json`.

```json
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": ""
  },
  "Azure": {
    "OpenAIApiKey": "",
  }
```

Next create the planner with your key, `OpenAIPlanner` or `AzureOpenAIPlanner`

```c#
builder.Services.AddSingleton<OpenAIPlannerOptions>(_ => new OpenAIPlannerOptions(
  config.OpenAI.ApiKey,
  // other settings
));

```

and create the planner and application with AI options.

```c#
builder.Services.AddTransient<IBot, Application>(sp =>
{
    // create the prompt manager
    // Prompt Manager directs to the Prompts folder
    IPromptManager<TurnState> promptManager = new PromptManager<TurnState>("./Prompts");

    // Create the prediction engine
    IPlanner<TurnState> planner = new OpenAIPlanner<TurnState>(sp.GetService<OpenAIPlannerOptions>()!);

```

`AI` is passed into the Application, which should recieve the two components above.

```c#
    {
        AI = new AIOptions<TurnState>(planner, promptManager)
        // other settings
        Storage
    };

    return new Application(applicationOptions);
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.Run();

```
