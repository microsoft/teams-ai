# Activity Routing

4. [Other](../OTHER/README.md)

When an incoming activity reaches the server, the bot adapter handles the necessary authentication and creates a `TurnContext` object that encapsulates the activity details. It then calls the `OnTurnAsync` method. This is the entry point method of the application. Here's what happens in this method:

1. If configured in the application options, pulses of the `Typing` activity are sent to the user.
2. If configured in the application options, the @mention is removed from the incoming message activity.
3. The turn state is loaded using the configured turn state manager.
4. The `OnBeforeTurnAsync` activity handler is executed. If it returns false, save turn state to storage.
5. All text-based messages are handled through `OnMessageActivityAsync`. If there is an AI setup and `OnMessageActvityAsync` throws a `NotImplementedException`, then `ChainAsync` is called and executed.
6. The `AfterTurnAsync` activity handler is executed. If it return true, save turn state to storage.

These six steps happen every time an incoming activity is received by the server.

If you are familiar with botbuilder, you already know the basics of turn flow in Teams AI. The main differences are `BeforeTurn`, `AfterTurn`, and how AI fits into the system.

Here's a diagram of the turn flow:
