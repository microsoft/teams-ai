- [**00.OVERVIEW**](./README.md)
- [Bot Framework Emulator](./BOTFRAMEWORK-EMULATOR.md)

- [Teams Toolkit extra information](./TEAMS-TOOLKIT.md)
- [Teams Toolkit CLI](./TEAMS-TOOLKIT-CLI.md)

## Different ways to run the samples

These docs have been separated out from the samples in order to reduce the minimum amount of reading to get up and running. The above information remains the same regardless of what sample you are running, so instead of repeating the same instructions in every sample, we are grouping them away from the samples to reduce the length of said sample README.md's.

> This section of the documentation will cover extra topics such as:

1. [Bot Framework Emulator](./BOTFRAMEWORK-EMULATOR.md) setup for testing the samples locally outside of Teams
1. [Teams Toolkit further info](./TEAMS-TOOLKIT.md) gives insight on how TTK works
   - How the various `.env` files work together
   - Changes needed to make scenarios like different AI services work for you
1. [Teams Toolkit CLI](./Teams-Toolkit-CLI.md) is for testing the samples using the CLI instead of Visual Studio Code's or Visual Studio's TTK extensions
1. [Manual resource setup](./MANUAL-RESOURCE-SETUP.md) for those who want to manually create the resources needed for the samples

Please let us know if you have any questions about this documentation or the samples by filing an issue or discussion topic.
