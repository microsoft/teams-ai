## Different ways to run the samples

> This section of the documentation will cover extra topics such as:

1. Insight on how [Teams Toolkit setup](./TEAMS-TOOLKIT.md) works (and changes needed to make scenarios like different AI services work for you)
1. [Teams Toolkit CLI](./Teams-Toolkit-CLI.md) usage for testing out the samples using the CLI instead of Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio
1. [Bot Framework Emulator](./BOTFRAMEWORK-EMULATOR.md) setup for testing the samples locally outside of Teams.

These docs have been separated out from the samples in order to make viewing the samples slightly easier. The above information remains the same regardless of what sample you are running, so instead of repeating the same instructions in every sample, we are grouping them away from the samples to reduce the length of said sample README.md's.

Please let us know if you have any questions about this documentation or the samples by filing an issue or discussion topic.
