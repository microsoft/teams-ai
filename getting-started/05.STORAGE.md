_Memories_ are a powerful way to provide broader context for your ask. Historically, we've always called upon memory as a core component for how computers work: think the RAM in your laptop. For with just a CPU that can crunch numbers, the computer isn't that useful unless it knows what numbers you care about. Memories are what make computation relevant to the task at hand.

We access memories to be fed into storage in one of three ways — with the third way being the most interesting:

1. Conventional key-value pairs: Just like you would set an environment variable in your shell, the same can be done when using storage. The lookup is "conventional" because it's a one-to-one match between a key and your query. 

2. Conventional local-storage: When you save information to a file, it can be retrieved with its filename. When you have a lot of information to store in a key-value pair, you're best off keeping it on disk.

3. Semantic memory search: You can also represent text information as a long vector of numbers, known as "embeddings." This lets you execute a search that compares meaning-to-meaning with your query.

# Examples

Here we define a default in-memory storage to be used. If needed the `IStorage` or `MemoryStorage` interface can be 
expended to support your own custom storage needs.

## C#

```C#
ApplicationOptions<AppState, AppStateManager> ApplicationOptions = new()
{
    TurnStateManager = new AppStateManager(),
    Storage = sp.GetService<IStorage>(),
    AI = aiOptions,
};
```

## Javascript

```typescript
const storage = new MemoryStorage();
const app = new Application<ApplicationTurnState>({
    storage,
    ai: {
        planner,
        promptManager,
        prompt: 'chatGPT'
    }
});
```
