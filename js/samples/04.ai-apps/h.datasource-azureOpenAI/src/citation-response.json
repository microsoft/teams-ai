It is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United\nStates and Canada and is considered the premier professional basketball\nleague in the world.[3]\n\nThe league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball\nAssociation of America (BAA).[1] It changed its name to the National\nBasketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing\nNational Basketball League (NBL).[4] In 1976, the NBA and the American\nBasketball Association (ABA) merged, adding four franchises to the NBA.\nThe NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing\n82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June, culminating\nwith the NBA Finals championship series. As of 2020, NBA players are the\nworld's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.[5][6][7]\n\nThe NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[8] which is\nrecognized by the FIBA (International Basketball Federation) as the national\ngoverning body for basketball in the United States. The league's several\ninternational as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head\noffices in Midtown Manhattan, while its NBA Entertainment and NBA TV\nstudios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey. In North\nAmerica, the NBA is the third wealthiest professional sport league after the\nNational Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) by\nrevenue, and among the top four in the world.[9]\n\nThe Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers are tied for the most NBA\nchampionships with 17 each. The reigning league champions are the Denver\nNuggets, who defeated the Miami Heat in the 2023 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the\nmajor ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States\nand Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto\nHuskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a\ngame the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history.[10] The\nfirst basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although\nthere had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the\nAmerican Basketball League (ABL) and the NBL, the BAA was the first\nleague to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its\nearly years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in\ncompeting leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem\nGlobetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to\nthe BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion\n\nHistory\n\nCreation and BAA–NBL merger (1946–1956)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_NBA_season\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:National_Basketball_Association_logo.svg\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:National_Basketball_Association_logo.svg\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)\nhttps://en.wikipedia",

              "content": "Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in\nFebruary) at 3 pm Eastern Time.[115] After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the\nremainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before\nthe trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.\n\nAround the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as\nwell as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, postseason teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the\nbest player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of\nthe Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the\nplayer who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year\nAward is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the\nmost positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for\n(his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year\nAward to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\n\nThe postseason teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five\nplayers. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the\nmost desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two\nAll-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.[116][117]\n\nThe NBA playoffs begin in April after the conclusion of the regular season and\nplay-in tournament with the top eight teams in each conference, regardless of\ndivisional alignment, competing for the league's championship title, the Larry\nO'Brien Championship Trophy. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular\nseason record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).\n\nHaving a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the\nplayoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed,\nthe third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having\na higher seed typically means a team faces a weaker opponent in the first round.\nThe team in each series with the better record has home-court advantage,\nincluding the First Round.\n\nThe league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each\nconference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015–16 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to\nthe division winners.[118]\n\nPlayoffs\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2016_Cleveland_Cavaliers_NBA_Finals_Trophy_(48884707998).jpg\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2016_Cleveland_Cavaliers_NBA_Finals_Trophy_(48884707998).jpg\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O%27Brien_Championship_Trophy\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O%27Brien_Championship_Trophy\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_MLK_Day_games\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game_MVP\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Stars_Challenge\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Stars_Challenge\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend_Skills_Challenge\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend_Skills_Challenge\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Point_Contest\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Slam_Dunk_Contest\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_deadline\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone\nhttps://en.wikipedia",
