This guide is intended to help you get started with bots and AI. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a conglamerate of tips that most bots moving to AI will require.

**Please note, you will need to install node v16.x** or higher

## AI Setup

Once you have a basic bot setup, it is time to prepare the bot for AI usage.

To use OpenAI, first create your OpenAI API key using the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/) and storing that key in your .env file:

```sh
MICROSOFT_APP_ID=app-id
MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD=app-password
OPENAI_API_KEY=new-OpenAI-Key
```

Next is to set up the planner, `AzureOpenAI` or `OpenAIPlanner` in this SDK.

```js
// Create prediction engine
// Azure OpenAI service:
const planner = new AzureOpenAIPlanner({
      /* AI config settings */
  });
// Open AI service:
const planner = new OpenAIPlanner({
      /* AI config settings */
  });

// create the prompt manager
// Prompt Manager directs to the prompts folder
const promptManager = new PromptManager((path.join(__dirname, `../src/prompts`));
```

The `ai` object is passed into the Application, which should recieve the two components above, as well as the default prompt.

```js
const app = new Application({
  storage,
  ai: {
    planner,
    promptManager,
    prompt: "defaultPrompt"
    // ... other options
  }
});
```
