# Meta Llama in Microsoft Teams

This sample implements a custom model to utilize Meta Llama's capabilities in Microsoft Teams. The bot is built to allow Meta Llama to facilitate the conversation by generating text completion based on what the user inputs, e.g. "Shave and a haircut"

<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->

## Summary

## Setting up the sample

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/teams-ai.git
    ```

2. In the root JavaScript folder, install and build all dependencies

    ```bash
    cd teams-ai/js
    yarn install
    yarn build
    ```

3. In a terminal, navigate to the sample root.

    ```bash
    cd teams-ai/js/samples/00.s.ample-name/
    ```

4. Duplicate the `sample.env` in the sample's folder. Rename the file to `.env`.

5. Update the `.env` file with your bot's `MICROSOFT_APP_ID` and `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD`. Under `Api_Key`, add the API key for the model you want to use.

6. Update `config.json` and `index.ts` with your model deployment name.

## Testing the sample

The easiest and fastest way to get up and running is with Teams Toolkit as your development guide. To use Teams Toolkit to automate setup and debugging, please [continue below](#using-teams-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code).

Otherwise, if you only want to run the bot locally and build manually, please jump to the [BotFramework Emulator](../README.md#testing-in-botframework-emulator) section.
For different ways to test a sample see: [Multiple ways to test](../README.md#multiple-ways-to-test)

### Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this sample's directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Ensure that you have set up the sample from the previous step.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.
