Dear [Manager], 

I wanted to let you know that the feature we are working on will be delayed by a week. This is due to an issue in the pipeline of our partner team. We will be working together to bring the feature back on track as soon as possible.
Thank you for your understanding. 

[Your Name]

Is this okay?
