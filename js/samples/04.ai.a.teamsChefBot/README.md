# Microsoft Teams Conversational Bot with AI: Teams Chef

This is a conversational bot for Microsoft Teams that thinks it's a Chef to help you cook apps using the Teams AI Library. The bot uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model to chat with Teams users and respond in a polite and respectful manner, staying within the scope of the conversation.

## Summary

This sample illustrates how to use [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Retrieval-augmented_generation) to easily inject contextual relevant information into the prompt sent to the model. This results in better and more accurate replies from the bot.

The sample uses a local Vector Database, called [Vectra](https://github.com/Stevenic/vectra), and [Semantic Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search) to find the most relevant information to include in the prompt for the users input. The index can be found in `./index/teams-ai` and includes all of the projects Getting Started docs and the source code for the Teams AI Library. This means you can ask the Teams Chef Bot anything about the library and it can answer it. You can even ask it to write sample code for you!

## Setting up the sample

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/teams-ai.git
    ```

2. In the root JavaScript folder, install and build all dependencies

    ```bash
    cd teams-ai/js
    yarn install
    yarn build
    ```

3. In a terminal, navigate to the sample root.

    ```bash
    cd teams-ai/js/samples/04.ai.a.teamsChefBot/
    ```

4. Duplicate the `sample.env` in this folder. Rename the file to `.env`.

5. Add your bot's credentials and any other related credentials to that file. If you are using OpenAI then only keep the `OPENAI_KEY` and add in your key. Otherwise if you are using AzureOpenAI then only keep the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` variables and fill them in appropriately.

6. Update `config.json` and `index.ts` with your model deployment name.

## Testing the sample

The easiest and fastest way to get up and running is with Teams Toolkit as your development guide. To use Teams Toolkit to automate setup and debugging, please [continue below](#using-teams-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code).

Otherwise, if you only want to run the bot locally and build manually, please jump to the [BotFramework Emulator](../README.md#testing-in-botframework-emulator) section.
For different ways to test a sample see: [Multiple ways to test](../README.md#multiple-ways-to-test)

### Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this sample's directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Ensure that you have set up the sample from the previous step.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.
