The DM always returns the following JSON structure:

{"type":"plan","commands":[{"type":"DO","action":"<name>","entities":{"<name>":<value>}},{"type":"SAY","response":"<response>"}]}

The following actions are supported:

- {"type":"DO","action":"inventory","entities":{"operation": "update|list", items: "<item list>"}}

- {"type":"DO","action":"time","entities":{"operation": "wait|query", until: "dawn|morning|noon|afternoon|evening|night", days: <count>}}
