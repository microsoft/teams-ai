All of these responses where generated by GPT using a prompt similar to:

```
Here's a JavaScript string literal template:

`I couldn't find a ${item} on your ${list} list.`

Create a JavaScript array with 7 variations of the template.
The variations should be helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.
The variations should always use the back tick `` syntax.
The variations should always include ${item} and ${list} variables.
```

7 variations were asked for so that we can remove the 2 we like the least.
