## Interacting with the bot

You can interact with the bot by messaging it and it will echo that back to you.

## Setting up the sample

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/teams-ai.git
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To prevent issues when installing dependencies after cloning the repo, copy or move the sample directory to it's own location first.

1. If you do not have `yarn` installed, install it globally

    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn@1.21.1
    ```

1. In the root **JavaScript folder**, install and build all dependencies

    ```bash
    cd teams-ai/js
    # This will use the latest changes from teams-ai in the sample.
    yarn install #only needs to be run once, after clone or remote pull
    yarn build
    # To run using latest published version of teams-ai, do the following instead:
    cd teams-ai/js/samples/<this-sample-folder>
    npm install --workspaces=false
    npm run build
    ```

1. In a terminal, navigate to the sample root.

    ```bash
    cd samples/<this-sample-folder>/
    yarn start
    # If running the sample on published version of teams-ai
    npm start
    ```

1. Duplicate the `sample.env` file in this folder. Rename the file to `.env` and add your bot's credentials and any other credentials to that file. Alternatively, if you are using Teams Toolkit (see below), you can add these credentials to the `/env/.env.*.*` files.

## Testing the sample

The easiest and fastest way to get up and running is with Teams Toolkit as your development guide.

Otherwise, if want to learn about the other ways to test a sample, use Teams Toolkit or Teams Toolkit CLI, and more, please see our documentation on [different ways to run samples](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/getting-started/OTHER#different-ways-to-run-the-samples).

To use Teams Toolkit, continue following the directions below.

### Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Copy this sample into a new folder outside of teams-ai
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this sample's directory
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Ensure that you have set up the sample from the previous step.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams..

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.
