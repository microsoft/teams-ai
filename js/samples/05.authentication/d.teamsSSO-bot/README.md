# Teams SSO Bot

This sample shows how to incorporate a basic conversational flow with SSO into a Microsoft Teams application using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) and the Teams AI SDK.

This sample depends on Teams SSO and gives you more flexibility on how to configure AAD, like using a client certificate. There is no need to create an OAuth Connection in Azure Bot Service to run this sample.

## Showcase

-   The bot echos back any message it receives. That's it!
-   This app is the bot-equivalent of 'Hello world'.
-   The minimum setup shows how to set up a bot with the Teams AI SDK.
-   This sample leverages Teams SSO to acquire a token for app user.

## Setting up the sample

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/teams-ai.git
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To prevent issues when installing dependencies after cloning the repo, copy or move the sample directory to it's own location first.

1. If you do not have `yarn` installed, and want to run local bits, install it globally

    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn@1.21.1
    ```

1. In the root **JavaScript folder**, install and build all dependencies

    ```bash
    cd teams-ai/js
    # This will use the latest changes from teams-ai in the sample.
    yarn install #only needs to be run once, after clone or remote pull
    yarn build
    # To run using latest published version of teams-ai, do the following instead:
    cd teams-ai/js/samples/<this-sample-folder>
    npm install --workspaces=false
    npm run build
    ```

1. In a terminal, navigate to the sample root.

    ```bash
    cd samples/<this-sample-folder>/
    yarn start
    # If running the sample on published version of teams-ai
    npm start
    ```

1. Duplicate the `sample.env` in this folder. Rename the file to `.env`.

1. Fill in the `.env` variables with your keys.

## Testing the sample

The easiest and fastest way to get up and running is with Teams Toolkit as your development guide. To use Teams Toolkit to automate setup and debugging, please [continue below](#using-teams-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code).

Otherwise, if you only want to run the bot locally and build manually, please jump to the [BotFramework Emulator](../README.md#testing-in-botframework-emulator) section.
For different ways to test a sample see: [Multiple ways to test](../README.md#multiple-ways-to-test)

### Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Copy this sample into a new folder outside of teams-ai
1. Select File > Open Folder in VS Code and choose this sample's directory
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Ensure that you have set up the sample from the previous step.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.
