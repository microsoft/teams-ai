    <summary><h3>Bot scaffolding</h3></summary>
    Throughout the 'index.ts' file you'll see the scaffolding created to run a simple Bot, like storage, authentication, task modules, and action submits.

    <summary><h3>Prompt engineering</h3></summary>
The 'prompts/hint/skprompt.txt' file has descriptive prompt engineering that, in plain language, instructs GPT how the bot should conduct itself at submit time. For example, in 'skprompt.txt':

**skprompt.txt**

```
You are the AI in a game of 20 questions.
The goal of the game is for the Human to guess a secret within 20 questions.
The AI should answer questions about the secret.
The AI should assume that every message from the Human is a question about the secret.

GuessCount: {{$conversation.guessCount}}
RemainingGuesses: {{$conversation.remainingGuesses}}
Secret: {{$conversation.secretWord}}

Answer the humans question but do not mention the secret word.

## Setting up the sample

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/teams-ai.git
    ```

2. In the root JavaScript folder, install and build all dependencies

    ```bash
    cd teams-ai/js
    yarn install
    yarn build
    cd samples/04.e.twentyQuestions
    ```

3. Duplicate the `sample.env` in the `teams-ai/js/samples/04.e.twentyQuestions` folder. Rename the file to `.env`.

4. Add your bot credentials to the `.env` file. If you are using OpenAI then only keep the `OPENAI_KEY` and add in your key. Otherwise if you are using AzureOpenAI then only keep the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` variables and fill them in appropriately.

5. Update `config.json` and `index.ts` with your model deployment name.

## Testing the sample

The easiest and fastest way to get up and running is with Teams Toolkit as your development guide. To use Teams Toolkit to automate setup and debugging, please [continue below](#using-teams-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code).

Otherwise, if you only want to run the bot locally and build manually, please jump to the [BotFramework Emulator](../README.md#testing-in-botframework-emulator) section.
For different ways to test a sample see: [Multiple ways to test](../README.md#multiple-ways-to-test)

### Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this sample's directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Ensure that you have set up the sample from the previous step.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.
