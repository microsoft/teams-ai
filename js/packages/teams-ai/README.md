# Teams AI Library

Welcome to the Teams AI Library JavaScript package!

This SDK is specifically designed to assist you in creating bots capable of interacting with Teams and Microsoft 365 applications. It is constructed using the [Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js) as its foundation, simplifying the process of developing bots that interact with Teams' artificial intelligence capabilities. See the [Teams AI repo README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai), for general information, and .Net & Python support is available via the [dotnet](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/dotnet) & [python](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/python) folder respectively.

Requirements:

-   node v18.x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - See [details about ending support for node 16](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/issues/1371)
